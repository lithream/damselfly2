add total free space / largest block (1 is ideal), subtract 1 from metric

add udw command to find full memory pool bounds

at t=1373 malloc pool, address 3789752640, tile 2449
red
but first op happens at 5307
why?

op at 3583 in malloc pool can be queried at t=3583. however the block appears before that at t=3000
address = 3789735104, tile 256

that means it got baked into the cache base at t=3000 when it should be part of the temporary updates
